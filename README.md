EasyActor
=========

EasyActor implements a subset of [Actor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for the .Net platform.

EasyActor´s main goal is to provide a lightweigth, fast, easy to use framework to transform POCO in actors. 

If you are looking for a complete Actor solution including remoting, resiliency and monitoring take a look at [akka.net](http://getakka.net/).


Motivation
--------------

* Simplify concurent programing getting rid of manual lock hell.
* Use actor concept: actor leaves in their own thread and comunicate with immutable message.
* Leverage C# 5.0 ansychroneous API (Task, async , await): actors comunicate with other component with Task
* Receive return from actor with Task<T>
* Transparent for consumer: EasyActor actors can be any C# interface returning Task.
* Fast: performance overhead should be minimum

Features
--------

EasyActor provide a factory allowing the transformation of POCO in actor that are then seen trougth an interface.
Actor guarantees that all calls to the actor interface will occur in a separated thread, sequencially.

In order to work, The target interface should only expose methods returning Task or Task<T>.
If this not the case, an exception will be raised at runtime when calling a none compliant method.
Make also sure that all method parameters and return values are immutable to avoid concurrency problems.


Usage - Example
--------------

Create an actor:

	//IFoo definition
	public interface IFoo
	{
	    Task Bar();
	}
		
	//ConcreteFoo definition
	public class ConcreteFoo : IFoo
	{
	    public Task<int> Bar()
	    {
	      return Task.FromResult<int>(2);
	    }
	}
	...
	//Instanciate actor facory
	var fact = new ActorFactory();
		
	//Instanciate an actor from a POCO
	var fooActor = fact.Build<IFoo>( new ConcreteFoo());
	...
	//This will call ConcreteFoo Bar in its own thread
	var res = await fooActor.Bar();
		
### Actor factories

EasyActor provide currently two Actor factories. An actory factory implements the IActorFactory

	//Factory to create actor from POCO
	public interface IActorFactory
	{
            //Build an actor from a POCO
            //T should an interface througth which the actor will be seen
            T Build<T>(T concrete) where T : class;
	}

Standard factory is ActorFactory that will instanciate actors living each in its own thread:

	var factory = new ActorFactory(priority:Priority.AboveNormal);

Priority argument (default to Normal) define the priority of the threads where Actor methods will run. This value maps directly with Thread priority.

	public enum Priority
	{
	    Lowest,
	    BelowNormal,
	    Normal,
	    AboveNormal,
	    Highest
	}
	
SharedThreadActorFactory is a factory where actors will share the same thread:

	var factory = new SharedThreadActorFactory(priority:Priority.AboveNormal);


This option may be helpfull if you have to create a lot of actors which have to perform short lived methods and you do not want to create a thread for each one. Same as ActorFactory priority argument (default to Normal) define the priority of the thread where Actor methods will run.

### SynchronizationContext

EasyActor also guarantees that code running after awaited task will also run on the actor Thread (in a similar way than task on UI Thread). This is done by setting the actor´s thread SynchronizationContext. For example: 		

	//ConcreteFoo definition
	public Task Bar()
	{
	      //Run on actor thread
	      .....
	      await AnotherTask();
	      
	      //This code also run on actor thread
	      ....
	}

### Life Cycle

Actor created by ActorFactory have a life cycle that can be controlled independently one from each other using the IActorLifeCycle interface that they implement.
Actor created by SharedThreadActorFactory have the same life cycle that can be controlled using the IActorLifeCycle implemented on SharedThreadActorFactory.

IActorLifeCycle has two methods:

	public interface IActorLifeCycle
	{
	      Task Abort();

	      Task Stop();
	}
	
- Abort:
	- Cancel all the queued tasks: only currently executing task will be run to completion if any
	- Call IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync on the proxified actor(s) if implemented
	- Prevent further call to actor to be executed: actor will only return cancelled Tasks
	- Terminate actor thread 
- Stop:
	- Prevent further call to actor to be executed: actor will only return cancelled Tasks
	- Wait for completion of all the queued tasks
	- Call IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync on the proxified actor(s) if implemented
	- Terminate actor thread 	
	
[IAsyncDisposable](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/114) is the asynchroneous version of IDisposable:

	public interface IAsyncDisposable : IDisposable
	{
		/// <summary>
		///  Performs asyncronesouly application-defined tasks associated with freeing,
		///  releasing, or resetting unmanaged resources.
		/// </summary>
		Task DisposeAsync();
	}

How it works
------------
Internally, EasyActor use [Castle Core DynamicProxy](https://github.com/castleproject/Core) to instaciate a proxy for the corresponding interface.
All calls to the interface methods are intercepted and then redirected to run on the actor Threads.
